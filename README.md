Adventure web project.

I was building this project during my self-education advanced CSS and Sass. The online course was taken from Udemy "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I have changed a lot of content, text, pictures, colors, etc. just not to follow the copy-past process and for better understanding.

The main valuable techniques and CSS properties that I have learned working on this project are:

    1. How CSS works behind the scenes
    2. The main principles of Sass. Variables, nesting, mixins, functions. Install the npm package to compile sass.
    3. Implementing the 7-1 CSS Architecture with Sass.
    4. Basic Principles of Responsive Design and Layout Types.
    5. Advanced CSS animation technics.
    6. Mobile-First vs Desktop-First and Breakpoints.
    7. Writing Media Queries.
    8. Responsive images. Art Direction, Density Switching, Resolution Switching
    9. Testing for Browser Support with @supports.
    10. Setting up a Simple Build Process with NPM Scripts.
